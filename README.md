## BUSINESS MATRICES USED
1.	Average Daily Rate (ADR): ADR signifies the average price charged for each room per day. It's computed by dividing the total room revenue by the number of rooms sold.
2.	Occupancy Percentage (%): This metric calculates the ratio of occupied rooms to the total available rooms, serving as a critical performance indicator.
3.	Revenue: Revenue encompasses the total income generated by the hotel, including earnings from room bookings, dining services, and events.
4.	RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room): RevPAR represents the revenue generated per available room, whether occupied or not. It aids hotels in assessing their revenue-generating performance for accurate room pricing. RevPAR also enables comparisons with other properties or brands.
5.	Average Rating: The average rating is the mean score or rating given by guests based on their stay experience, often sourced from guest reviews and surveys.
6.	No Show Rate (%): This metric reveals the percentage of guests who make reservations but do not arrive at the hotel as scheduled.
7.	Daily Booked Room Night (DBRN): DBRN indicates, on average, how many rooms are booked for a specific day within a given timeframe.
8.	Daily Sellable Room Night (DSRN): DSRN represents, on average, how many rooms are available for sale on a particular day within a specified period.
9.	Daily Utilized Room Night (DURN): DURN denotes, on average, how many rooms are effectively utilized by customers for a given day during a specific timeframe.
10.	Realization (%): Realization is the percentage of successfully "checked-out" bookings out of all the reservations made.
The comprehension and tracking of these metrics are crucial for a hotel's success, as they contribute significantly to pricing optimization, resource allocation, and the improvement of overall guest satisfaction in hotel management.
